I just stumbled out of the theater, feeling like I just spent two hours on a roller coaster that never really decided if it was going up or down. In the Lost Lands... yeah, that's definitely one way to put it. I mean, I'm not even sure who was more lost, the characters or me. Gotta love a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that leaves you scratching your head wondering if the protagonist knew they were a protagonist.

Honestly, I’m still processing what I've seen. Those scenes with the landscapes—wild, beautiful, confusing, almost like someone dumped a bunch of Bob Ross paintings in a blender and forgot to put the lid on. There's this scene where a dragon pokes its head out of a cloud, and I swear, it felt like it was looking right at me, as if to say You look just as confused as I feel being in this  . 

Gray Alys, the sorceress, she’s something else. More like the love child of Gandalf and a tired librarian who secretly practices witchcraft after hours. I couldn't decide if I wanted to hug her or run away—and not just because of her magic tricks. She had this aura of someone who knows too much but says too little, and her sarcasm was truly on point.

>The plot felt like overcooked pasta, sticking to places it shouldn’t, but hey, maybe that was the whole point? The whole “mystical quest” vibe they had going on made me wonder if the writers were on a quest of their own to find coherent storytelling. And the soundtrack? It was like a drunk jazz musician met an orchestra in a dark alley and they decided to jam together.

There’s this line where someone asks if Gray Alys can “transform dreams into ashes or something. Pretty sure my brain did just that halfway through, transforming any hopes of understanding into a puff of smoke. Yet, somehow, I can’t shake the nagging thought that I want to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to see if it makes more sense the second time around. Oh, the joys of cinematic masochism.

Now, I don’t want to spoil too much, but the ending... let’s just say it was like someone served a gourmet meal and forgot to add salt. Possibly intentional, possibly an oversight, who knows? But somehow, despite everything, it all worked. Sort of. It’s the kind of   that sticks with you like that weird dream you had after eating too much cheese. Feeling exhausted but oddly satisfied, like finishing a shift at the restaurant from hell but knowing you did something memorable. Beautiful chaos, indeed.
